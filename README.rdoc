= iso_country_codes

== ABOUT THIS FORK:

DO NOT USE THIS.

We have wrong codes for three countries in some legacy systems and we have to deal with it.
In the meantime, we applied our wrong codes to this gem for an easier upgrade path.

== DESCRIPTION:

Provides ISO codes, names and currencies for countries.

== FEATURES:

* Find by alpha-2, alpha-3 or numeric codes
* Search by name, currency code or calling/dialing code

== SYNOPSIS:

  # Finding an ISO code returns the country name and other code formats
  code = IsoCountryCodes.find('au')
  code.name      # => "Australia"
  code.numeric   # => "036"
  code.alpha2    # => "AU"
  code.alpha3    # => "AUS"
  code.calling   # => "+61"
  code.continent # => "OC"
  
  # Codes can be found via numeric, alpha-2 or alpha-3 format
  IsoCountryCodes.find(36)
  IsoCountryCodes.find('au')
  IsoCountryCodes.find('aus')

  # Codes can also be returned by searching country name, currency or calling/dialing code
  IsoCountryCodes.search_by_name('australia')
  IsoCountryCodes.search_by_currency('aud')
  IsoCountryCodes.search_by_calling_code('+61')

  # Fetch a country's local currency
  IsoCountryCodes.find('aus').currency # => "AUD"

  # Output an Array of countries and their codes for use form helper methods
  IsoCountryCodes.for_select # => Array
